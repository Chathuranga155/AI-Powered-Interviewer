# Learning Materials for Binary Search

## Understanding Binary Search

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science that efficiently finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It's a perfect example of the divide-and-conquer algorithmic paradigm.

### How Binary Search Works

1. Start with the middle element of the array
2. If the target value equals the middle element, we're done
3. If the target value is less than the middle element, search the left half
4. If the target value is greater than the middle element, search the right half
5. Repeat until the element is found or the search space is empty

Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much more efficient than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets.

### Implementation Approaches

**Iterative Implementation:**
- Use a loop with left and right pointers
- Calculate middle index in each iteration
- Adjust pointers based on comparison with target
- Continue until element is found or search space is exhausted

**Recursive Implementation:**
- Base case: search space is empty (left > right)
- Calculate middle index and compare with target
- Recursively search appropriate half based on comparison
- Return result from recursive call

### Key Implementation Concepts

**Middle Index Calculation:**
```go
mid := left + (right - left) / 2  // Avoid potential overflow
```
This approach prevents integer overflow that could occur with `(left + right) / 2` for large arrays.

**Loop Condition:**
Use `left <= right` for the loop condition to ensure all elements are checked.

**Pointer Updates:**
- If target is greater than middle: `left = mid + 1`
- If target is less than middle: `right = mid - 1`

## Binary Search Edge Cases

When implementing binary search, be mindful of these common edge cases:

1. **Empty array**: Check if the array is empty before searching
2. **Single element array**: Make sure your algorithm works for arrays with just one element
3. **Target smaller than all elements**: Handle the case when the target is smaller than the smallest element
4. **Target larger than all elements**: Handle the case when the target is larger than the largest element
5. **Duplicate elements**: Decide how to handle multiple occurrences of the target value
6. **Integer overflow**: When calculating the middle index, use proper overflow-safe arithmetic

## Binary Search Applications

Binary search is used in many real-world applications:

1. **Database Systems**: For indexing and searching records
2. **Debugging**: For finding bugs in large codebases (binary bug search)
3. **Machine Learning**: For hyperparameter tuning
4. **Library Functions**: Used in standard library functions like `sort.Search` in Go
5. **Computer Graphics**: For ray tracing and collision detection algorithms

## Binary Search Variants

There are several variants of binary search:

1. **First occurrence**: Find the first occurrence of an element if duplicates exist
2. **Last occurrence**: Find the last occurrence of an element if duplicates exist
3. **Closest element**: Find the element closest to the target value
4. **Rotated sorted array**: Find an element in a sorted array that has been rotated
5. **2D binary search**: Binary search in a 2D sorted matrix
6. **Insertion position**: Find where an element should be inserted to maintain sorted order

## Algorithm Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) - The search space is halved in each iteration
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - Iterative: O(1) - Uses only a constant amount of extra space
  - Recursive: O(log n) - Due to the recursive call stack
