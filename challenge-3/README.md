# Challenge 3: Employee Data Management

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with managing a list of employees with the following details: `ID`, `Name`, `Age`, and `Salary`. Implement a `Manager` struct that provides the following functionalities:

1. **AddEmployee**: Add a new employee to the list.
2. **RemoveEmployee**: Remove an employee based on their ID.
3. **GetAverageSalary**: Calculate the average salary of all employees.
4. **FindEmployeeByID**: Retrieve an employee's details by their ID.

## Structures and Function Signatures

Define the following structures:

```go
type Employee struct {
    ID     int
    Name   string
    Age    int
    Salary float64
}

type Manager struct {
    Employees []Employee
}
```

Implement the following methods:

```go
func (m *Manager) AddEmployee(e Employee)
func (m *Manager) RemoveEmployee(id int)
func (m *Manager) GetAverageSalary() float64
func (m *Manager) FindEmployeeByID(id int) *Employee
```
