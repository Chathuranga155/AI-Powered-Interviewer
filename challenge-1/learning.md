# Learning Materials for Sum of Two Numbers

## Basic Go Syntax and Functions

In Go, functions are first-class citizens and are defined using the `func` keyword. This challenge focuses on basic function implementation and understanding Go's syntax for arithmetic operations.

### Function Declaration

```go
// Basic function structure
func FunctionName(parameter1 Type1, parameter2 Type2) ReturnType {
    // Function body
    return returnValue
}
```

For example, a function to add two integers would be:

```go
func Add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

You can also specify parameter types once for multiple parameters of the same type:

```go
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Basic Data Types in Go

Go has several basic types including:

- **Numeric types**: 
  - `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
  - `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uintptr`
  - `float32`, `float64`
  - `complex64`, `complex128`
- **String type**: `string`
- **Boolean type**: `bool`

For this challenge, we're working with the `int` type.

### Arithmetic Operators

Go supports the following arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%` (remainder after division)

### Variables in Go

Go variables are declared using the `var` keyword or the short declaration operator (`:=`):

```go
// Using var
var a int = 10
var b int = 20

// Short declaration (type is inferred)
a := 10
b := 20
```

### Testing in Go

Go has a built-in testing framework in the `testing` package. Tests are functions that start with `Test` followed by a name that starts with a capital letter.

```go
func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := Add(2, 3)
    if result != 5 {
        t.Errorf("Add(2, 3) = %d; want 5", result)
    }
}
```

### Go's Philosophy

Go is designed for simplicity, readability, and efficiency. It encourages:

- Clear and concise code
- Strong typing
- Efficient compilation and execution
- Built-in concurrency support (though not needed for this challenge)
